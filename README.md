# üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Gym Trainer AI

**Gym Trainer AI** is a real-time desktop application that uses artificial intelligence and computer vision to monitor and analyze gym workouts‚Äîspecifically bicep curls. It captures live webcam input, analyzes form using AI, counts repetitions, and gives visual feedback on posture and performance.

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gym_trainer_gui.py       # Main GUI interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ trainer.py               # Contains AITrainer logic (your implementation)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gym-trainer-ai.git
cd gym-trainer-ai
```

### 2. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

> Tkinter is usually pre-installed. On Ubuntu/Debian:  
> `sudo apt install python3-tk`

---

## üìÑ requirements.txt

```
opencv-python
numpy
```

Add other dependencies if you use ML models or pose estimation libraries.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the App

Make sure you have a webcam connected.

```bash
python gym_trainer_gui.py
```

- Click **‚ñ∂ Start Analysis** to begin  
- Click **‚ñ† Stop Analysis** to end  
- Or press `Q` in the video window to quit  

---

## üß† Expected AI Output Format

The method `analyze_frame()` in `AITrainer` (from `trainer.py`) must return:

```python
(annotated_frame, feedback_data)
```

Where `feedback_data` looks like:

```python
{
  "metrics": {
    "reps": 10,
    "form_score": 91,
    "elbow_angle": 74.2
  },
  "messages": [
    "‚úÖ Great elbow control!",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è Try to slow the lowering phase.",
    "‚ùå Don‚Äôt swing your upper arms."
  ]
}
```

## ‚ùó Troubleshooting

| Problem                  | Fix                                               |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Camera not working       | Ensure it's plugged in and not used by another app |
| GUI freezes              | Ensure threading is correctly implemented          |
| No feedback shown        | Check your `trainer.py` logic                      |
| Reps not counted         | Make sure elbow tracking is implemented            |
